In this chapter,  we have learned how to find the current date and time, how to add to and subtract 
from dates, how to find the difference between two dates, and how to parse dates and times from 
strings. In the next chapter, you will learn how to work with maps and arrays in the Go language. 
You will see practical examples for manipulating and iterating arrays, merging arrays and maps, and 
testing whether a key is present in a map.
